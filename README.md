METI

METI is a Python toolkit for detecting exoplanets using the transit method, which identifies small dips in star brightness when a planet passes in front of its host star. The repository includes scripts for preprocessing astronomical images, detecting stars, tracking their brightness, and building light curves from which potential exoplanet transits can be observed. Sample datasets and utilities are provided to make experimentation quick and accessible.
